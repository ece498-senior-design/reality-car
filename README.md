# AndReality Car

## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to design an Android mobile technology controlled RC car that employs augmented reality. The basic idea is to mount an Android camera phone together with a IOIO board on a RC car to serve as the camera for the behind-the-wheel view as well as the controller for the car's motors (both steering and drive).  The IOIO gives us the ability to control input and output ports through Android programming.  We will be using a hobby-grade RC car to take advantage of the easy to connect/modify setup up of the internal electronics as well as the existence of servos for proportional steering.

In addition, this hobby-grade RC car will be large enough to provide room under the shell for the camera phone to be mounted.  On the user-interface end, an Android Tablet will serve as the remote control for the car by communicating wirelessly with the car-mounted device via direct-connect WIFI or the mobile network.  The user will be able to control steering and speed by tilting the tablet in various directions.  In addition, a 2.5 turn lock-to-lock USB steering wheel/ gas pedal setup will be incorporated as a plug-in controller to the tablet to provide real-life simulated control over the RC car.  Furthermore, augmented reality will be integrated into the user’s screen providing the user with a virtual racetrack that overlays the real image captured by the camera in the form of pre-set checkpoints for the user to drive the RC car through.
